🛡️ Saver Protocol

Saver Protocol is a revolutionary "No-Loss" GameFi platform that combines the power of DeFi (Decentralized Finance) with the entertainment of Gaming.

Inspired by Alchemix's "Self-Repaying Loans" mechanism, Saver Protocol allows users to play games, bet, and earn without ever fearing the loss of their initial principal.

🌟 The Core Concept

Saver Protocol operates on the principle of "Play with Yield - Keep the Principal":

Deposit: Users deposit Stablecoins (USDT, USDC) into the Saver Vault.

Yield Generation: The Vault automatically deploys funds to farm yield on reputable DeFi protocols (Aave, Compound, Yearn...) with a projected APY of ~20%.

Borrow: Users borrow $srUSD (Saver USD) game tokens based on the future yield generated (up to 50% LTV).

Play & Earn: Use $srUSD to participate in PvP games.

If you Win: You receive more $srUSD and can swap it for real money.

If you Lose: You only lose the borrowed $srUSD. This debt is automatically repaid over time by the yield generated from your deposited principal. Your principal remains safe.

🎮 Game Ecosystem (Game Dashboard)

Saver Protocol currently supports thrilling PvP (Player vs Player) games:

1. 💣 Bomb Panic (Survival)

Genre: Hot Potato / Survival.

Rules: A ticking time bomb is passed between players. Whoever holds the bomb when the timer hits zero is eliminated and loses their bet. The last survivor takes the entire Pool.

Mechanism: The longer you hold the bomb, the higher the Reward Multiplier, but the greater the risk of explosion.

2. 🎲 Crypto Tycoon (Board Game)

Genre: Crypto Monopoly.

Rules: Roll dice to move across the board. Buy "Tokens" (properties) like BTC, ETH, SOL.

Features: Collect gas fees (rent) when others land on your spot. Watch out for "Rug Pull" (Jail) or "Tax" slots.

3. 🔫 Russian Roulette (Coming Soon)

Genre: High Stakes Chance.

Rules: 1 bullet, 6 chambers. The last one standing is king.

4. 📈 Binary Market (Coming Soon)

Genre: Price Prediction.

Rules: Predict if Bitcoin price will go Up or Down in the next 30 seconds.

💎 Tokenomics: $SVR (Saver Token)

$SVR is the governance and utility token of the ecosystem, turning players into "The House".
